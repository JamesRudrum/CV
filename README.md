## Profile

I am a former 3D artist who read engineering at university and has learnt to code at Makers Academy. I’m seeking a new challenge after working within technology and art sector and to build upon this knowledge and continue to learn within this sector, specifically development and applications. I want to use my interpersonal and problem solving skills gained during my education and previous experience to work for an organisation where I can make a meaningful contribution. I am keen to follow my dream within this new industry having finished the intensive 16 week full stack development course at Makers Academy.

## Skills

#### Project Management

- One of my last projects I was part of at Field.io was the making of an interactive installation for  Microsoft Azure. The aim of this project was to show how supply chains can be agile and on-demand when run in the cloud. During this project I was placed in a production role where I was liaising with all people linked to the project to ensure that all the necessary parts of the project came together seemlessly. This included me meeting with, and then if necessary following up with, light suppliers, fabricators, glaziers, van rentals and others to ensure that our time scale in studio was met. I was chosen to fulfil this role due to my previous experience with dealing with suppliers in London, my willingness to travel across London to ensure the projects success and due to my boss at the time beleiving in my interpersonal skills were at a point where I could add a lot to this project in this role. This role was deffinitely a new and challenging experience for me as I hadn't been involved with client or supplier side interactions during my design career before. However after dealing with a multitude of issues, such as personally procurring and delivering across London a key piece of glass was the correct spec, size and standard needed on the projects Saturday morning delivery date. The final project can be seen [here](https://www.field.io/project/microsoft-responsive-potential/). This skillset has also come into use during my time at Makers Academy when being involved as part as projects such as [Acebook](https://github.com/teamnameundefined/acebook-team-name-undefined) and [MakersBnB](https://github.com/ellieturno/MakersBnB).

#### Design Processes

- During my time as a a 3D animator I used an array of different software to create work for things as varied as blokbuster films to installation experiences. This experience has given me and strong design background and keen eye for detail. Most of this work has been done under a producer allowing me to develop my skill by working to a strict time limit and budget. Also I this work was focused on iterating based on client feedback ensuring that I kept flexible and could follow a brief whilst adding creative elements. Visit http://www.jr3d.co.uk/ to see some of my personal website for some of my animation work. 

#### Problem Solving

- I really enjoy solving problems, and it is at the core of my decision to become a developer. I get engrossed in barriers or bugs that inevitably arise on any project, and I enjoy being able to succesfully find creative solutions. I have been able to hone this skills during my time at makers however I also feel I have been able to do this during my time as a designe. This is because I was routinely switched between projects depending on the man power needed and I wasn't always an expert in the paryicular software required. However I was always able to contribute and add to the project.

#### Punctuality & Determination

- I believe that all the skills, knowledge and experiences I have acquired are due to my consistent effort of being on time and striving to do my best. I not only believe that this is the best way to respect myself but also to respect my colleagues and those who I am in contact with. This belief and mindset is what has ensured I have graduated univerity, experienced a different culture and country in Sweden, worked on Blockbuster films and now (hopefully) moved into software development, all of which I am proud of and grateful to have achieved.
