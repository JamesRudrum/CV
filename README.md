I'm a former 3D artist who read engineering at university and has learnt to code at Makers Academy. I've worked on films and installations during my time as a 3D artist and enjoyed my time doing both, however I now I want to use my interpersonal and problem solving skills gained during my education and previous experience to work for an organisation where I can make a meaningful contribution. I have wanted to work with tech, software and code since working at the art and technology creative studio [Field](www.field.io). At Field I worked with talented artists and creatives who used VEX and Python to create scripts or node networks for Houdini. This led me down the path of looking into how code,tech, data and animation can be combined to create beautiful pieces or data paintings, similar to the work created to [Refik Anadol](http://refikanadol.com). I beleive that my time spent at Makers Academy will help me combine the art, engineering and programming worlds of my life combine.

## Skills

#### Use of 3D 7 Design Software

- During my time as a a 3D designer I used an array of different 3D software to create work for things as varied as blokbuster films to installation experiences. This experience has given me and strong design background and keen eye for detail. Most of this work has been done under a producer allowing me to develop my skill by working to a strict time limit and budget. Also I this work was focused on iterating based on client feedback ensuring that I kept flexible and could follow a brief whilst adding creative elements. Visit [here](www.jr3d.co.uk) to see some of my personal website for some of my animation work. 

#### Project Management

- One of my last projects I was part of at Field.io was the making of an interactive installation for  Microsoft Azure. The aim of this project was to show how supply chains can be agile and on-demand when run in the cloud. During this project I was placed in a production role where I was liaising with all people linked to the project to ensure that all the necessary parts of the project came together seemlessly. This included me meeting with, and then if necessary following up with, light suppliers, fabricators, glaziers, van rentals and others to ensure that our time scale in studio was met. I was chosen to fulfil this role due to my previous experience with dealing with suppliers in London, my willingness to travel across London to ensure the projects success and due to my boss at the time beleiving in my interpersonal skills were at a point where I could add a lot to this project in this role. This role was deffinitely a new and challenging experience for me as I hadn't been involved with client or supplier side interactions during my design career before. However after dealing with a multitude of issues, such as personally procurring and delivering across London a key piece of glass was the correct spec, size and standard needed on the projects Saturday morning delivery date. The final project can be seen [here](https://www.field.io/project/microsoft-responsive-potential/). This skillset has also come into use during my time at Makers Academy when being involved as part as projects such as [Acebook](https://github.com/teamnameundefined/acebook-team-name-undefined) and [MakersBnB](https://github.com/ellieturno/MakersBnB).
