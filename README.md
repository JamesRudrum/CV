## James Rudrum

I'm a former 3D designer who has (hopefully) learnt to code at Makers Academy. I've worked on blockbuster films and installations in the past but now I want to use my problem solving skills to make stuff and expand on my engineering and tech background.

## Skills

#### Use of 3D Software (C4D & Maya)

- During my time as a a 3D designer I used both C4D and Maya to create work for things as varied as blokbuster films to VR experiences. This experience has given me and strong design background and keen eye for detail. Most of this work has been done under a producer allowing me to develop my skill by working through feedback, however when working with a client it has allowed me to focus on creation under a strict time limit.
